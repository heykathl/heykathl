- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @heykathl but people usually call me Kathleen. I decided to leave my career as a Town Planner to embark on this journey to pursue a more fulfilling and creative professional direction. 
- ðŸŒ± I graduated as a Software Engineer at Makers Academy and currently work as a Junior Software Developer, focusing on messaging, archiving and compliance technology.
- ðŸ’» If you would like to collaborate on projects, please give me a buzz!
