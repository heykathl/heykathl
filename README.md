- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @heykathl but people usually call me Kathleen. I decided to leave my career as a Town Planner to embark on this journey to pursue a more fulfilling and creative professional direction. 
- ğŸ‘€ I have an interest in fitness and self-care, where I enjoy going to the gym, hiking and have recently picked up cycling and yoga. 
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™ve recently graduated as a Software Engineer at Makers Academy. 
- ğŸ’» If you would like to collaborate on projects, please give me a buzz!
